This library enables to use Consul as cluster coordinator in a ConstructR based node.  

[ConstructR](https://github.com/hseeberger/constructr) aims at cluster bootstrapping (construction) by using a coordination service and provides etcd as the default one. By means of this library, you will be able to use [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) as coordination service instead.

You will need to add the following dependency in your `build.sbt` in addition to the core ConstructR ones:

```scala
// All releases including intermediate ones are published here,
// final ones are also published to Maven Central.
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("tecsisa", "maven-bintray-repo")

libraryDependencies ++= Vector(
  "com.tecsisa" %% "constructr-coordination-consul" % "0.7.0",
  ...
)
```

## Configuration ##

Check [this section](https://github.com/hseeberger/constructr#coordination) in ConstructR for general information about configuration.

Configure the Consul agent name under the agent-name configuration setting:

```
constructr.consul.agent-name = name
```

We strongly recommend configuring this property so that Consul can release every session created by the ConstructR nodes and later reconnections can work properly. More details [here](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/sessions.html).
Not configuring this property might lead to inconsistent state. This configuration is typically carried out by a cluster scheduler that will have the consul agent name available. Of course, manual configuration is always possible too.

If you are using the [ACL System](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/acl.html) configure the Consul token:
```
constructr.consul.access-token = token
```

## Testing

Requirements:
  - consul needs to be running, e.g. via ` docker run -d -p 8501:8500 --name constructr-consul consul:latest agent -server -bootstrap -client=0.0.0.0`

## Demo

We have built a working demo for you. [Try it out!](constructr-coordination-demo/)
